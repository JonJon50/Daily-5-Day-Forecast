**Hi üëã, I'm John Hagens**


- One of my biggest motivations for the project was incrementing the API into all user locations for better experiences. 
- Using Geofetch for everyone to be a part of the interaction. Know the weather ahead of time, from the smallest concern like remembering an umbrella to saving lives. 
- Protecting loved ones from a hurricane. By achieving this goal, made me a better coder and person by changing the world one code at a time.
